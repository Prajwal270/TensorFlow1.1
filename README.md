# TensorFlow1.1
Using Tensorflow to implement the basic algorithms.

## Dataset used :
- Fashion mnist
- mnist

## Content present in the repository files :
- Basic of Tensoflow 1
- Implementation of keras ( using Tensorflow backend) 
- Implementation of CNN using Keras
- Building model to predict Fashion minst dataset 


## Software Required (Basic setup)
- IPython environment and Jupyter notebooks
- Python 3
- Conda for package management and virtual environments

If it is not able to install and run these software on the local system
then, online [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notbook can be used to do the same.

## Language and Libraries 
- Python 3 and above
- pandas => For Exploratory Data Analysis 
- numpy => to work with dimensions (arrays)
- matplotlib => to visualize the data, and look for pattern
- seaborn => to get over all analysis of data using graphs
- Tensoflow
- keras
